0	42	Values of Phosphate are slightly decreased	MP:0000198

771					
As shown in Figure 2C, administration of acetic acid in the control group resulted in mortality rate of 10 % while induction of colitis in mice exposed to acrylamide (20 and 30 mg/kg/day) caused a higher rate of mortality (30% and 50%, respectively).

In contrast, in control colitis mice intrarectal use of acetic acid produced an inflammatory reaction characterized by submucosal edema, leukocyte infiltration, epithelial damage, and loss of goblet cells.

As shown in Figure 4B the histopathological score was also increased in both acrylamide groups as compared with the control colitis mice.

Acetic acid-induced oxidative stress in colon tissue leads to the depletion of SOD, GSH, and catalase as endogenous anti-oxidants (Figures 5C, D, and E).

789					
Effect of acrylamide onthe level of NO and the expression of iNOS As shown in Figures 6A and B, acetic acid-induced ulcerative colitis increased iNOS expression and the production of NO in colon tissue.

151	192	inflammatory damage in the colonic tissue	MP:0003304

Effect of acrylamide onthe level of cytochrome-c and caspase-3 As shown in Figure 8, induction of colitis increased the levels of cytochrome-c and caspase-3 as makers of apoptosis in colon tissues of colitic mice when compared with the normal saline-treated mice.
